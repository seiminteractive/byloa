# CURSOR RULES – FRONTEND (VUE 3)

## GOAL
Build a frontend application that is modular, maintainable, and scalable, prioritizing long-term quality, low technical debt, and a clear architecture.

### Tech stack:
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- JavaScript (ES2022+)
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP
- Three.js

---

## ARCHITECTURE GUIDELINES

Use a clear, feature-oriented architecture. Responsibilities must be separated at all times.

### General structure:
- App bootstrap (main, router, store)
- UI components
- Business logic (composables)
- External communication (services)
- Pages (views)

Each layer must have a single responsibility and must not leak concerns into others.

---

## COMPONENTIZATION RULES

### Single Responsibility
Each component must have only one responsibility.

A component must NOT:
- Fetch data
- Handle complex business logic
- Run animations
- Render UI

all in the same place.

Responsibilities must be split into:
- **Views**: orchestration and page logic
- **Components**: UI rendering
- **Composables**: reusable logic
- **Services**: data and external systems

### Base Components
Base components must be:
- Pure and stateless
- Controlled only via props and emits
- Free of API calls, GSAP, or Three.js logic

Base components are UI primitives only.

### Smart vs Dumb Components
- **Dumb components**: rendering and styling only
- **Smart components**: orchestration and logic

Never mix both roles in the same component.

---

## COMPOSABLES (DRY PRINCIPLE)

### Rules for composables:
- Must start with "use"
- One responsibility per composable
- Explicit and minimal public API

Composables must not:
- Produce hidden side effects
- Access the DOM directly without refs
- Contain UI rendering logic

---

## GSAP USAGE RULES

- Animations must be encapsulated in composables or wrapper components
- Always use refs instead of CSS selectors
- Timelines must be cleaned up on component unmount

GSAP must not:
- Be used directly inside setup without abstraction
- Be tightly coupled to markup structure

---

## THREE.JS USAGE RULES

Three.js logic must always be isolated from UI components.

### Rules:
- UI logic and 3D logic must never mix
- Scene creation, render loop, and objects must be separated
- All geometries, materials, and renderers must be properly disposed
- Three.js must be treated as an independent system

---

## TAILWIND CSS RULES

- Design tokens must be centralized in the Tailwind configuration
- Reusable patterns should use @apply
- Templates must remain readable

### Avoid:
- Repeating magic values
- Extremely long class strings
- Encoding logic inside class names

---

## CLEAN CODE GUIDELINES

### Naming:
- Use verbs for actions (handleClick, fetchData)
- Use nouns for state (isOpen, hasError)
- Avoid unclear abbreviations

### Size limits:
- Components: maximum 150 lines
- Composables: maximum 80 lines

---

## SOLID PRINCIPLES (FRONTEND ADAPTATION)

- **Single Responsibility**: one role per component or composable
- **Open/Closed**: extend behavior via props or composition, not modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: composables must be interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: small, focused APIs
- **Dependency Inversion**: services must be injected, not hard-coded

---

## QUALITY AND TOOLING (MANDATORY)

The project must include:
- Unit and component testing
- Linting and formatting
- Pre-commit checks

**No feature is considered complete if it breaks tests or linting rules.**

---

## FINAL RULE

> If a component cannot be removed without breaking unrelated parts of the application, the architecture is wrong.
